<h1>Loading Sequences</h1>
<p>
Re-DOT-able requires two sequence files in order to draw a plot.  Each file must be
a DNA or RNA sequence file, in FastA format, which can potentially contain several
sub-seqences.  A so-called multi-fasta file.
</p>

<p>
A typical input sequence file for the program will look like this:
</p>

<pre>
&gt;seq1 this is the first sequence
GAGGCTTATGCGGCTATGCGTAGTCGTAGTGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCTAGTGCA
ATATGCGTATTATATAAGGCGCGATATCGATCTGATGCTGTATGCTAGCGGTG
AGGATCTGAGGAGAGGCGCGGATATATATGATGATGTGAGCGATGCGATGTGT
&gt;seq2 this is the second sequence
ATATGCGTATTATATAAGGCGCGATATCGATCTGATGCTGTATGCTAGCGGTG
AGGATCTGAGGAGAGGCGCGGATATATATGATGATGTGAGCGATGCGATGTGT
&gt;seq3 this is the third sequence
GCTTATGCGGCTATGCGTAGTCGTAGTGCTAGTCGTAGCTAGCTAGTGCA
</pre>

<p>
The main identifier for each sub-sequence will be the first set of non-whitespace
text after the &gt; sign.  Any further text after that on the header line will be
retained as the sequence description.  The name for the sequence set as a whole
will be taken from the filename from which the sequences were loaded.
<p>

<p>
You can have as many or as few sequences in each file as you like.  The sequence
can contain either N bases or ambiguity codes, but these will all be treated as 
mismatches when calculating alignments.
</p>

<p>
Before you can calculate an alignment you must have loaded a sequence file into
both the x and y axes of the plot.  If you want to compare a sequence against 
itself then simply load the same file twice.
