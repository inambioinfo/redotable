<h1>Creating an Alignment</h1>

<p>
Once you have loaded two sets of sequences into the program
you can create an alignment.  The alignments in re-DOT-able
are word-based, meaning that it looks for exact matches of 
a given length or longer.
</p>

<p>
There are two values which determine the alignment parameters
within re-DOT-able.  The main one is the search word size. This
is the minimum match length which will be reported by the 
program.  You can interactively increase this cutoff in the 
interactive view, but the value set when running the alignment
is the lower bound, which can't be changed without recalculating
the alignment.
</p>

<p>
The default word size for re-DOT-able is 50, but this can be
lowered by going to View &gt; Preferences.  Any change in 
setting will take effect when the next alignment is calculated.
Making the value lower will report shorter matches, and will
result in a more sensitive (but possibly slower and noisier)
search.
</p>

<p>
The other value which relates to the alignment is the index
word size.  The search algorithm operates by hashing the 
k-mer positions in one of the sequences and looking them up
in the other.  The index word size defines the kmer size used
for the hashing, and therefore also defines the minimum word
size which can be used for the search.  Currently re-DOT-able
uses an index word size of 10, and this isn't currently 
configurable.
</p>

<p>
Once you have set the word size you want to use for your
search, you can start the alignment using File &gt; Start Aligning.
