<h1>Modifying Dotplots</h1>
<p>
Re-DOT-able offers a number of ways to modify the presentation of your dotplots
once they have been calculated.
</p>

<h2>Interactive view</h2>
<p>
The main graphical dotplot view is interactive and offers a number of ways
to alter the display of the dotplot.  Most of the controls are keyboard or
mouse shortcuts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> Click and drag: Zoom in. The plot will fill the selected area.</li>
	<li> Mouse scroll wheel: Translate up and down along the y-axis sequence.</li>
	<li> Shift + Mouse scroll wheel: Translate left and right along the x-axis sequence</li>
	<li> Pause curor over plot: A popup will appear showing the sequence and position under the cursor</li>
</ul>

<p>
To the right of the plot is a slide bar which can be raised to increase the filter
on the minumum length of alignment segment being shown in the display.  The lowest 
position will show all calculated alignments, down to the word size set in the preferneces
when the alignment was calculated.  The highest positions increases the stringency of the
filter to 10X the original length.
</p>

<h2>Sequence Properties</h2>
<p>
Under View &gt; Sequence Properties you can access a dialog which allows you to 
change the properties of all of the sequences in your alignment.  Any changes will
immediately be implemented in the main view.
</p>

<p>
The dialog appears as a pair of tables, with the x-sequences on top and the y-sequences
below.  Clicking on the header of any of the columns will sort the corresponding table
by the values in that column.
</p>

<p>
Properties which you can change are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The direction of the sequence. Clicking on the revcomp box will reverse
	complement the sequence and any associated alignments</li>
	<li>The highlighting of the sequence.  If the highlight box is ticked then
	the full height or width of the plot covered by that sequence will have a
	background highlighted in yellow.  If sequences on the x and y axes are both
	highlighted then the intersecting area will highlight in orange.</li>
	<li>The position of the sequences.  The &quot;raise&quot; and &quot;lower&quot;
	buttons will adjust the position of the sequence in the plot</li>
	
</ul>

<h2>Display Preferences</h2>

<p>
There are a couple of options which are set from the main preferences panel,
these are whether grey lines are drawn up or across the plot to indicate the
edges of the sub-sequences in the main x or y sequences.  These can be changed
individually for the x and y axes.
