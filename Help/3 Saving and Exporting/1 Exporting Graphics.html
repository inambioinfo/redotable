<h1>Exporting Graphics</h1>

<p>
Once a dotplot has been created then you can export it into a 
stand-along graphics file to use in documents or presentations.
The save function can be accessed via File &gt; Save dotplot.
</p>
<p>
From within the save dialog which opens you can select the 
format you want to use for the graphic.  The two options
are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Portable Network Graphics (PNG)</li>
<li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The PNG format is effectively a screenshot of the current 
view of the graphics window.  The resolution is the same as
the resolution of the image on your screen.  This file format
is widely accepted and will import into most programs which 
can accept graphics.
</p>

<p>
The SVG format is an editable vector graphics format and is
more suitable where you want to ammend the graphic before using
it, or if you need higher resolution, for example for use in
publications.  The format is less widely read by general purpose
graphical software, but is the accepted standard for vector
graphics.
</p>

<p>
Whichever format is selected, the exported graphic will reflect
the current display options for the plot, and the current 
zoom and aspect ratio settings.
