<h1>Saving Sequences</h1>
<p>
If you have used re-DOT-able to re-order or assemble your 
sequences then you will probably want to export out a modified
version of your sequences.  This option is accessible after a 
dotplot has been created and can be found at File &gt; Save sequences
and will save the results to a FastA format sequence file.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
The save sequences tool has a number of options to adjust the
extent and format of the sequence data saved by the tool.
</p>
<h3>Which sequence</h3>
<p>
From the drop down list you can select whether you are exporting
the sequences from the X or Y axes.
</p>
<h3>Merge Sequences</h3>
<p>
The FastA file format allows for multiple independent sequences
to be saved into the same file.  If this option is off then 
your sequences will be written out as independent sub-sequences
within the file.  If it is turned on then they will be merged
together into a single sequence entry.
</p>
<h3>Separate with polyN length</h3>
<p>
This option is only active if you opt to merge sequences together.
If you do this then the value in this option denotes the number of
N-bases which will be added between different sequences to denote
a transition from one sub-sequence to the next. If you just want the
sequences joined end-to-end then set this value to zero.
</p>
<h3>Save bases</h3>
<p>
Indicates whether the actual bases of the sequences will be written
out.  If this is option is not selected then only the sequence 
headers will be written, and not the actual data.
</p>
<h3>Add description</h3>
<p>
If this is selected then if the originally imported sequences had
description text after the main sequence identifier, then this will
be added back to the sequence headers when they are written out again.
</p>
<h3>Annotate length</h3>
<p>
If this is selected then the length, in base pairs, of each sequence
will be added to the header after the identifer, but before the 
description.
</p>
<h3>Annotate strand</h3>
<p>
If this is selected then the strand of each sequence
will be added to the header after the identifer, but before the 
description.  This will be expressed relative to the orientation
the sequence had when it was originally imported, and will reflect
whether the sequence has been reverse complemented during the 
generation of the alignment and assembly.
