RELEASE NOTES FOR REDOTABLE v0.1
--------------------------------

This is an initial beta release of the software which now has enough 
functionality to be useful. There are still major features which are
absent though, and many other parts may change dramatically over 
future releases.

Things which do work already are:

- Multi-fastq sequence loading
- Word based calculation of similarities, with configurable word sizes
- Interactive visualisation of dotplots, with zooming and filtering
- Automated restructuring of sequences to match a reference
- Manual reversing, ordering, hiding and highlighting
- Saving of re-ordered sequences
- Exporting graphics as PNG or SVG

Things which don't work:

- Saving dot plot projects
- Having any help at all
- Non-interactive mode
- Editing sequence names
