RELEASE NOTES FOR REDOTABLE v1.0
--------------------------------

This is the initial completed release of redotable.  We have now 
implemented all of the basic features we initially planned for the
software to have.  The program should be usable for real work in
its current state, but we are still keen for feedback on what we
could do better.

The main things which have been added in this release are:

- Added a command line interface
- Added zooming and panning to the main plot
- Completed saving sequences
- Added help for all functions

- Automated restructuring of sequences to match a reference
- Manual reversing, ordering, hiding and highlighting
- Saving of re-ordered sequences

- Saving dot plot projects
- Having any help at all
